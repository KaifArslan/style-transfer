# The Science of Personalization

Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommendation systems to make personalized product recommendations to users. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based.

## Dataset - [Criteo Uplift Modeling Dataset](https://ailab.criteo.com/criteo-uplift-prediction-dataset/)

This dataset is constructed by assembling data resulting from several incrementality tests, a particular randomized trial procedure where a random part of the population is prevented from being targeted by advertising. it consists of 25M rows, each one representing a user with 11 features, a treatment indicator and 2 labels (visits and conversions).

## Social and Economic Impact

Recommendation systems have had profound social and economic impacts. On a social level, they have transformed how people discover and consume information, products, and services, leading to personalized and often more satisfying user experiences. However, they have also raised concerns about filter bubbles and echo chambers, potentially reinforcing existing biases and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Economically, recommendation systems drive significant revenue for businesses by increasing user engagement, sales, and customer retention. They have revolutionized sectors like e-commerce, entertainment, and advertising, but their relentless pursuit of user attention has spurred debates about the ethics of addictive design and the exploitation of user data. Striking a balance between the positive and negative social and economic consequences of recommendation systems remains a critical challenge in our increasingly interconnected digital world.

## Usage

1.Data Collection:
Gather relevant data, whether it's user behavior data, surveys, or any other information that will help you analyze personalization. Ensure that you follow ethical guidelines and data privacy regulations.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data. This may involve data cleaning, data transformation, and handling missing values.

3.Data Analysis:
Apply appropriate data analysis techniques to extract insights from the data. This could include statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining methods, depending on the project's objectives.

4.Model Development:
If your project involves building recommendation systems or personalization algorithms, develop and train the necessary models. You may use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, deep learning, or other methods depending on your domain.

5.Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of your models or the effectiveness of your personalization strategies using appropriate metrics. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or domain-specific metrics.e. (Can be updated later on) ...
