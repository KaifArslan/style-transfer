# Accelerated Object Detection

“Accelerated object detection” typically refers to the process of optimizing and improving the speed and efficiency of object detection algorithms. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating object within an image or video frame. Accelerating this process is a crucial for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems and augmented reality.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib pandas

3. Run the script:
python ADN_rps.py

4. Training Process
- Train the model on your annotated dataset. During training, the model will learn to predict object locations and classes.
- Monitor training progress by tracking metrics like loss, accuracy, and mAP (mean average precision).
- Implement techniques like learning rate scheduling to fine-tune the training process

5. Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported.

6. Saving the Model
- The trained model is saved to the "Accelerated_object_detection_model" directory.

# note - Code for particular step will be updated later.
